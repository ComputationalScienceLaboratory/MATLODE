        <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
        <p>The mission for implementing a general sensitivity analysis MATLAB Toolbox for non-stiff and
stiff ordinary differential equations is to fill the void in MATLAB&#39;s current ODE suite and establish a
standard open source MATLAB Toolbox which bridges the gap between mathematicians and computer
scientists. Several free MATLAB libraries are readily available in their respective field, but none encourage 
collaboration within their scientific community. MATLODE is a small step for the computational
science community to produce reliable, reusable code to accelerate progress both within the ordinary
differential equation community and, most importantly, the areas of study that rely on our state of the
art numerical software.<br><br>
The purpose of MATLODE is not for solving computationally expensive models. MATLODE&#39;s purpose is
to provide a framework and validated milestones at every release so scientists do not have to continue to
reproduce results from their colleges for every new discovery. Instead, scientists can submit an extension
to MATLODE so that their hard work and findings can be used by others. Of course with every stable
release, specific recognition and citations to all contributors will be updated in the documentation and
software package.<br><br>
MATLODE should not be the only maintained MATLAB open source numerical software. Rather the
computational science community should have a super toolbox where the community can approve which
additions should be included in the next release. As a community we should create an exploratory software 
package where the key components are ideas and not necessarily computing performance. For high
performance libraries we should continue to build standalone libraries since maintaining these libraries
as a community would be too cumbersome.</p>
